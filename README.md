FoodRecipeApp"
This is a simple react project where I tried to fetch third party api(spoonacular) to generate food recipes and ingredients used. Using this api I displayed the image of the of targeted recipe
and the ingredients in sorted manner. User can look up for the recipe and the item is displayed as the per click and preference.

Feature of the website:
- User can search for recipe
- View card is there where users can click on the view recipe
- Ingredients with images have been given upon clicking each recipe
- Instruction on how to make the recipe is also fetched which I have curated further for better user experience.
